# Welcome to FaceAI
FaceAI is a cutting-edge web application designed for photographers and image professionals, which leverages advanced facial recognition technology to facilitate rapid identification of individuals in a collection of images. This app operates on the TensorFlow deep learning framework, utilizing a pre-trained ResNet50 convolutional neural network to generate highly accurate and facial embeddings. These embeddings are then compared against a repository of pre-computed embeddings to determine the most similar match. The user interface provides a convenient and intuitive experience, enabling the simultaneous upload of multiple images and input of multiple search queries. The app is optimized for high performance, with a scalable architecture that enables fast search results even when working with a large-scale image dataset.

## Technical Overview
* The app leverages the TensorFlow deep learning framework to perform face embedding generation
* The ResNet50 model, pre-trained on a large-scale facial recognition dataset, is used for feature extraction and embedding computation
* The generated embeddings are compared against a pre-populated database of embeddings using efficient distance metric calculations
* The user interface allows for batch processing of multiple images and supports querying the database with multiple names
* The app is designed for high performance, utilizing techniques such as parallel processing and optimized data structures for large-scale image collections.



## Getting Started

To use the app, you will need to:

* Have a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
* Have an internet connection
* Upload the images you want to search through and input the name of the person you're looking for.
* Our algorithm will then search through the images and return any matches it finds.

## Support

If you have any questions or issues with the app, please don't hesitate to contact our Team.
