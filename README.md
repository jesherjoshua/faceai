# Welcome to FaceAI

FaceAI is a web application that utilizes state-of-the-art facial recognition technology to help photographers and image professionals quickly find matches of specific people in a collection of images. The app utilizes a TensorFlow machine learning framework and a pre-trained ResNet50 model to generate embeddings of faces, providing accurate and efficient search results.

## Technical Overview

* The app uses TensorFlow as the machine learning framework to generate embeddings of faces from the images.
* A pre-trained ResNet50 model is used to extract the facial features from the images and generate the embeddings.
* These embeddings are then compared to a database of pre-generated embeddings to find the closest match.
* The user interface allows for the uploading of multiple images and input of multiple names for searching.
* The app is optimized for efficient performance, allowing for fast search results even with a large collection of images.

## Getting Started

To use the app, you will need to:

* Have a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
* Have an internet connection
* Upload the images you want to search through and input the name of the person you're looking for.
* Our algorithm will then search through the images and return any matches it finds.
